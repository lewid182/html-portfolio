<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a big fan of anything that has to do with technology. I first found my love of technology with videogames. 
  I never really had a computer as a kid, only an old gateway PC that I was not aloud to use except to play a memory game.</p>

<p>My real passion for computers came in HighSchool. The public school I went to gave us macbooks to study and do homework with.
  They used to be locked down and you needed admin privileges to do anything fun. I had a thought, "I wonder if I could find a way to create 
  my own admin account." My thought process here was that they needed to be able to create admin accounts for the network admins.
  My assumptions were correct and I was able to create an admin account and without my knowledge, I essentially hacked my laptop.

<p>After that I started playing around with scratch and playing a lot of Minecraft. At this time I really got into the hardware
  aspect of computers. Over time I started slowly purchasing computer parts with the summer job I was working at my local amusement
  park. Once I got all the parts I spent a day on various forums and YouTube videos teaching myself how to assemble my very first PC.
  I didn't want to just go out and purchase a computer, I wanted to know how it worked. I wanted to have something I built and knew so
  if anything went wrong I could open it up and make repairs. This proved to be a very valuable asset I taught myself. It also showed me
  that with a simple google search you could learn anything you want, and for free!

  I was not satisfied. I knew a great deal about the hardware and knew every inch of my PC, but I wanted to learn about the software side.
  I wanted to get into modding Minecraft but that fell through as I enjoyed playing Minecraft more than I did modding it. 
  That and I felt the modding field was a bit saturated. I got into hacking (the ethical kind) and modding video game systems.

  It was in my young adulthood that I decided to get the ball rolling. Slowly over time I have been learning about coding and cyber security
  but I could not dedicate all my time as I had a child and another on the way. I felt I had to dedicate all the time I possibly could working 
  and spending time with my family. I was in the telecommunication field working as a broadband/fiber technician for about 5 years over
  various companies. I liked it but I didn't love it. I loved working with tech and being outside running fiber and coax lines. It was fun
  and kept me fit. I also did a fair bit of running and fitting data cables for ethernet as I was the lead commercial technician for
  MetroNet. That was a great experience but something was missing. I was building networks for homeowners and commercial buildings but it
  didn't feel unique. I didn't feel like my creativity was being challenged. Thats what got me into Web Development.

  My fiance got her degree and started a well paying job, giving me the chance to leave my job and learn Web Development. It was a hard
  choice to make but I made the choice to leave my career field and learn how to code. This website will document my journey and house
  any projects that I make. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!
